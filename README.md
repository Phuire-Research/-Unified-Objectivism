# PHUIRE <~> Unified Objectivism: Public Transparency
Formalized via **Logical Conceptualism** - Testable Conceptual Logic
### Abstract: Unified Objectivism
Is a Unified Method of Objectivism that is informed via Two Unified Constructs, the Outline, and Graph.
Where Work Done on One of the Constructs informs new Work to Be Done on the Unified Paired Construct.
Creates an Effective Recursive Means of Work.
Where the Method of Unifying the Two Data Formats represents the Trade Secrets of the Practitioner.

**The Outline** 
1. The First being the Outline which is a List of Goals
2. Each Goal has an Optimization Target denoted by ~>
   1. This is Used to Inform a Quality to be Maintained in the Scope of the Goal
3. Each Entry into this Outline is Supported via atleast 3 points to Achieve the Goal
   1. Otherwise is Considered Incomplete  

**The Graph**
1. Contains Concepts from the Outline
2. These Concepts are Connected via their Associations


### Summary of Purpose:
Unified Objectivism is a comprehensive approach aimed at the organization, understanding, and optimization of Objectives by decomposition of complex concepts and addressing the generalized artifacts within modern language and knowledge systems. The Core Idea is to formalize a methodology that Unifies various levels of understanding, methodologies, and technologies into an Emergent Unified Aggregate System. That is composed of Conceptual Sets and Testable in Reality.

It was with approach we Unearthed Unified Science. And while we wish we could just rely on such. We will be formalizing under Unified Conceptual Science, in the Format of Logical Conceptualism. And will be introducing an Unified Logical Conceptual Scientific Method of Programming that was Chanced Upon by the Author as early as 2013. As they did not want to choose a specialization within the Generalized Set of Disciplines they were presented with. Thus this Method is finding the shared Associations between Concepts to Translate a Skillset between all Possible Sets of Skillsets. Rejection of the Master of None in the Scope of Jack of All Trades.

This was done without the Understand of Unified Science until early 2023. Where They Discovered that Unified Science Had Served as the basis of an Attempt towards a Unified Theory of Science. Where the Unifying Format was that of Logic and Concepts. And also served as One of the Core Principles of Internet as it Conceived. For Example that of Hypercards and even that of UML.

But has been repeatedly been left behind in History. As core issue in regards to using Logic in Conjunction with Concepts to Unify Scientific Disciplines is the Number of Possible Arrangement of Concepts Outnumber the the total number Atoms within the Universe. As a consequence Unified Science at the start of 2023 had been Obfuscated within the Generalized Knowledge Base and by way of Failed Attempts towards Understanding associated with the Likes of Ancient Aliens, Sacred Geometry, Energy Healing, Etc... as of Early 2023. This in the Scope of Unified Conceptual Science would imply a Failure of Understanding to Land in Logic and being Lost in the Metaphor rather than Finding the Logical Implementation of Said Concepts. And is referred to Internally as the Godhead Delusion.
